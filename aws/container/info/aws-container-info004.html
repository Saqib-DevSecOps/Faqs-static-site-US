  <li value="1">TBD</li>
  <li>Short answer, No, though it's       technically possible.</li>
  <li>You can run Linux Containers       on a Windows host because the Windows host creates a Linux VM on the host       and runs the Linux Container on the host.</li>
  <li>&quot;Docker for Windows       allows you to simulate running Linux containers on Windows, but under the       hood a Linux VM is created, so still Linux containers are running on       Linux, and Windows containers are running on Windows.&quot; </li>
  <li>It can do the same (in       reverse) to run Windows Containers on a Linux host. However, it hasn't       yet, perhaps due to License restrictions and management overhead.</li>
