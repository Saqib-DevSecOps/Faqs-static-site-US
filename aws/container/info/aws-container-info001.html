  <li value="1"><strong>Note:</strong> Docker changed their       language on this from process to concern.</li>
  <li>&quot;It is generally       recommended that you separate areas of concern by using one service per       container.&quot;</li>
  <li>I.e. by recommendation, a       container should have one main process.</li>
  <li>That process may fork into       multiple processes. An example is where the Apache web server main process       would start multiple worker processes to handle incoming HTTP requests.</li>
  <li>If you have a need to connect       multiple processes together in a solution, you can tie multiple containers       together using user-defined networks and shared volumes.</li>
  <li>There are several reasons for       one main process per Container recommendation, including thatÂ  decoupling applications into multiple       containers makes it easier to scale horizontally and reuse containers. It       better supports a DevOps mindset where services are decoupled</li>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> this is a recommendation.       There are possibly edge cases that are credible exceptions</li>
