  <li value="1">Will AWS continue to offer both ECS and EKS longer term - they seem very similar?

<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">Both services will continue       to be supported, as far as I can tell</li>
  <li>They are both AWS Container       Orchestration/Management solutions, however general difference between ECS       and EKS is:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">ECS supports        Docker as the container engine; EKS supports Docker and other container        engines</li>
    <li>ECS orchestrates only Docker        Container Engines; EKS orchestrations a variety of Container Engines,        including Docker</li>
    <li>ECS is tightly integrated        with other AWS services; EKS is integrated with other AWS services, and        it is open-source Kubernetes conformant</li>
    <li>ECS offers simplicity,        making it easier to deploy standard architectures; EKS offers ability to        deploy a more enterprise architecture</li>
  </ol>
  <li>More research is needed</li>
</ol></li>
