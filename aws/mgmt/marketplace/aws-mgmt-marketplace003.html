<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">Instance Marketplace, are you       referring to Reserved Instance (RI) Marketplace? A place to sell Standard       Reserved Instances</li>
  <li>AWS freed customers from the       burden of carry along Standard RI that no longer met their needs by       allowing customer to re-sell them on the secondary marketplace, called the       RI Marketplace.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">The other type of        flexibility that AWS made available is that instead of, or in addition        to, Standard RIs, customer can purchase Convertible RIs, which affords        more flexibility than Standard RIs.</li>
    <li>Finally, AWS Savings Plan is        the latest, and most flexible options customer have to commit to a term        of use of EC2, Fargate, Lambda (with Compute Savings Plan), at a        significant discount in return for the commitment.</li>

  <li>Advantages of RI: You can       sell unused RI in the RI Marketplace. You can get discounts for RDS, as       well as EC2 with RIs.</li>
  <li>AWS Marketplace is the       general marketplace for AWS services</li>
