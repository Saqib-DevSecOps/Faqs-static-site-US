  <li value="1">Root       is the parent organizational unit (OU) for all accounts and       other OUs in your organization. </li>
  <li>Think of <strong><em>Root</em></strong> as       the <strong><em>top-level folder</em></strong> within AWS Organizations. It is the container       of all other resources in the Organization.</li>
  <li>This is <strong><em>not</em></strong> the       AWS <strong><em>Root Account user</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>The AWS Organizations <strong><em>Management Account</em></strong> is an AWS IAM User with <strong><em>administrative privileges</em></strong>.&nbsp; It is the account that       was used to create the AWS Organizations service itself.</li>
  <li>Note: This could also be an <strong><em>AWS Root Account</em></strong>, however this goes against best practice advice.&nbsp;</li>
