<em hidden="categorymeta">[AWS: Management:  AWS Organizations, Accounts]</em>
<ol type="a">
  <li value="1"><strong><em>Organization:</em></strong> group resources e.g. by environment, business       units, or even projects. Even if they are accessing the same resources,       the Finance teams account(s) is different from HRâ€™s account(s), for       example.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Service Quotas:</em></strong> Each AWS Account comes with limits or quotas for specific AWS       services. E.g. each account can create up to five VPCs per Region. Some       quotas can be increased on request, these are called soft quotas, others       are hard quotas and cannot be increased. Having multiple accounts provides       increased capacity.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Access Management:</em></strong> Accounts provide another layer of security, another way       to limit access, and to implement the principle of least privilege.</li>
