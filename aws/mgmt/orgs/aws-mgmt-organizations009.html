<em hidden="categorymeta">[AWS: Management:  AWS Organizations, Policy]</em>
<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">Yes.</li>
  <li>An SCP can be       applied to the Root, OU or individual account.</li>
  <li>An SCP applies at       the entity and below.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">When        you attach a policy to the organization root, all OUs and accounts in the        organization inherit that policy.</li>
    <li>When you attach        a policy to a specific OU, accounts that are directly under that OU or        any child OU inherit the policy.</li>
    <li>When you attach        a policy to a specific account, it affects only that account.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Note: While it's       attaching an SCP to a member account is allowed, carefully consider the       use-case. It might be better to create an appropriate Organizational Unit       (OU) for the account, and apply the SCP to the OU.</li>
