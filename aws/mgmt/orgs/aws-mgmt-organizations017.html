<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">A billing option that enables       customers to consolidate payment for multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS)       accounts</li>
  <li>Consolidated billing is a       feature leveraged by the AWS Organizations service to consolidate billing       and payment for multiple AWS accounts.</li>
  <li>Every organization in AWS       Organizations has a management (or payer) account that pays the charges of       all the member accounts.</li>
  <li>The benefits of Consolidated       Billing include:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1"><strong><em>One bill</em></strong> – The management        account is responsible for paying the charges of all the member accounts.        The member accounts can see their cost and usage, however it is for        informational purposes only.</li>
    <li><em>Easy        tracking</em> – The        management account can use consolidated billing to view aggregated usage        costs across multiple member accounts in the organization.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Combined        usage</em></strong> – The        usage across all accounts in the organization, can be combined to share        the volume pricing discounts, Reserved        Instance        discounts, and Savings Plans. This can result in a lower        charge for your project, department, or company than with individual        standalone accounts.</li>
    <li><strong><em>No extra        fee</em></strong> –        Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>N<strong>ote: &quot;</strong>SCPs are not available       in an organization in which only consolidated billing is enabled. For SCPs       to be available, you must enable all features in the organization.&quot;</li>
