<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">Scaling up or down is also       known as Vertical Scaling.</li>
  <li>The process of scaling up (or       scaling down) involves changing system capacity by adding (or removing)       capacity or system resources for a discrete instance.</li>
  <li>E.g. what if you have a web       server running on an EC2 Instance, and the web server needs more memory.       What would you do?</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">An EC2 Instance        comes with a set amount of CPU or memory capacity, e.g. a <em><strong>t3.large</strong></em>        EC2 Instance type has 2 vCPU and 8 GiB of memory</li>
    <li>If workload on this        Instance, e.g. your web server, needs more capacity, you provision a new        EC2 Instance, e.g. a <em><strong>c5.xlarge</strong></em> EC2 Instance type with 4        vCPU and 8 GiB, and move the workload to that new instance, giving it        access to more capacity</li>
    <li>This type of scaling, where        you increase the capacity of a discrete system, e.g. an EC2 Instance, is        known as <em><strong>Scaling Up</strong></em>, or also known as <em><strong>Vertical Scaling</strong></em>.<br>
      Note: Vertical Scaling can also involve a process of decreasing the        capacity of a discrete system, this is known as <em><strong>Scaling Down</strong></em>.</li>
  </ol>
