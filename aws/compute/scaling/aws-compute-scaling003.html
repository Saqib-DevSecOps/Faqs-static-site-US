  <li value="1">The process of scaling out       (or scaling in) involves changing system capacity by adding (or removing)       discrete system units</li>
  <li>I.e. you can Scale Out by       adding a second a EC2 Instance, providing that much more capacity for your       workloads. Scaling In involves removing capacity by for example going from       two to one EC2 Instance.</li>
  <li>This type of scaling (Scaling       Out or Scaling In) is also known as Horizontal Scaling, and it does NOT       involve having to restart the workload to either add capacity or remove       capacity</li>
  <li>EC2 Auto Scaling does       Horizontal Scaling, i.e. Scaling Out and Scaling In</li>
