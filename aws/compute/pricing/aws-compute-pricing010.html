  <li>AWS Budgets ca be used to       track and take action on your AWS cost and usage. One of the things that       AWS Budgets can monitor is the aggregate utilization and coverage metrics       for your Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans.</li>
  <li>In the AWS Billing Console,       you can use Budgets to track the utilization or coverage associated with       your reservations and receive alerts when your percentage drops below a       threshold you define. You can create the following RI-related budgets:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1"><strong><em>RI utilization budgets</em></strong></li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">Define a         utilization threshold and receive alerts when your RI usage falls below         that threshold.</li>
      <li>Setting a utilization         target lets you see if your reservations (Reserved Instances) are unused         or underutilized.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong><em>RI coverage budgets</em></strong></li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">Define a         coverage threshold and receive alerts when the number of your instance         hours that are covered by RIs fall below that threshold.</li>
      <li>Setting a coverage target         lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by reservations</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>Reservation alerts are       supported for:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">Amazon EC2</li>
