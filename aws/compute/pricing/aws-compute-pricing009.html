  <li value="1">For an RI to be       size-flexible:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">It must meet the        regional benefit criteria.</li>
    <li>It must have a platform        value of Linux/UNIX</li>
    <li>It must not be a G4 instance</li>
    <li>It must not have a dedicated        tenancy</li>
    <li>It must not be tied to a        specific Availability Zone</li>
    <li>Regional RI apply the        discount to any AZ in the Region</li>
  </ol>
  <li>&quot;Regional Reserved       Instances are purchased for a Region and provide Availability Zone       flexibility. The Reserved Instance discount applies to instance usage in       any Availability Zone in that Region.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Regional Reserved       Instances also provide instance size flexibility where the Reserved       Instance discount applies to instance usage within the instance family,       regardless of size.&quot;</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">Limitations        include Instance Size Flexibility does not apply to RI for Windows        Server, REL, SUSE,â€¦</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Convertible RI allow you to       change the Instance Family, and other parameters</li>
  <li>&quot;All Regional Linux/UNIX       RIs with shared tenancy now apply to all sizes of instances within an       instance family and AWS region&quot;</li>
