  <li value="1">AWS Savings Plans at present       only applies to EC2 Instances, Fargate, Lambda, SageMaker usage. &quot;If       your business is using Reserved Instances to save money on the cost of RDS       Instances, AWS Redshift, ElastiCache, Elasticsearch, or DynamoDB services,       you will have to continue using Reserved Instances until the new discount       program is extended to these services.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;You can get shorter       term RIs on the marketplace&quot;</li>
  <li>You get the same or slightly       higher discounts with RI over Savings Plan.</li>
