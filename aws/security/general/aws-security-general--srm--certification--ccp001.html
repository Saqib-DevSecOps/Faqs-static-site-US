  <li value="1">What is the Shared Responsibility Model?
<em hidden="categorymeta">[AWS: Security: General, Shared Responsibility Model, AWS Certification, CCP]</em>
<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">AWS says that, &quot;Security and compliance are shared responsibilities between AWS and the customer&quot;</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">There are things in the customer layer, e.g. identity and access management, that are solely the customer's responsibility</li>
    <li>There are things in the infrastructure layer, e.g. operating the physical data center, that are solely AWS' responsibility</li>
    <li>There are responsibilities that apply to both the customer layer and infrastructure layer, in different contexts, such that both Customer and AWS share in the responsibility, e.g.</li>
    <ol type="1">
      <li value="1">Patch management, where AWS applies patches within the infrastructure, and Customer patches the <strong><em>guest operating systems</em></strong> and applications</li>
      <li>Configuration Management where AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure devices, and the Customer has responsible for configuring their own guest operating systems, and applications</li>
      <li>Awareness and Training, where AWS trains AWS employees, and customers train their own employees</li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>When evaluating the security of a cloud solution, it is important for customers to understand and distinguish between the security <strong><em>of</em></strong> the cloud, and your security <strong><em>in</em></strong> the cloud.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">Security <strong><em>of</em></strong> the cloud encompasses the security measures that AWS implements and operates. </li>
    <li>Security <strong><em>in</em></strong> the cloud encompasses the security measures that customers implement and operate, related to the AWS services they use.</li>
