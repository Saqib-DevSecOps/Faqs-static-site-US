  <li value="1">The       principle of &lsquo;least privilege,&rsquo; means entities are only granted rights       enough to perform specific job-related tasks and no more.</li>
  <li>Least privilege is a       principle of granting only the permissions required to complete a task.</li>
  <li>Least privilege is one of       Amazon Web Services (AWS) Well-Architected best practices that can help       you build securely in the cloud.</li>
  <li>&quot;For example, if you       have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that needs to       access an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to get       configuration data, you should only allow read access to the specific S3       bucket that contains the relevant data.&quot;</li>
