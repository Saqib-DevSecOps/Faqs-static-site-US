<ol style="list-style-type: none">
  <li style="list-style-type: none">I've come across this term <em><strong>undifferentiated heavy lifting</strong></em>a lot. What does it mean?</li>
    <em hidden="categorymeta">[AWS: General: Information, Services]</em>
  <ol type="a">
    <li value="1">It points to        things companies would do well to hand-off to someone else to perform        because, while necessary/important:</li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li value="1">it is not core         to the company's business</li>
      <li>it does not differentiate         the business</li>
      <li>it might represent a         low/negative ROI</li>
    </ol>
    <li>In 2006, Jeff Bezos, Amazon        CEO at the time, called it the &quot;the <strong><em>undifferentiated yet        all-important</em></strong> heavy lifting needed to create and operate a web application.&quot;</li>
    <li>Depending on the AWS service        being used by the customer, undifferentiated heavy-lifting activities.        that customer can hand-off to AWS, might include one or more of the        following:</li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li value="1">Negotiating         contracts and licensing, hosting servers</li>
      <li>Installing and/or patching         applications and/or operating systems</li>
      <li>Configuring the operating         environments such as networking and firewalls, users and groups</li>
      <li>Creating scalable,         reliable, secure, highly-available, and cost-effective architectures</li>
      <li>Coordinating the multiple         teams needed to deploy and maintain the environment</li>
      <li>Etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Instead of focusing on        business infrastructure, companies and customers can focus on their        business by leaving the undifferentiated heavy-lifting to AWS</li>
    <li>For example, customers no        longer have to deal with the undifferentiated heavy-lifting of managing file servers and storage, as &quot;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/">Amazon FSx</a> automates administration tasks such as hardware        provisioning, software configuration, patching, and backups.&quot;</li>
    <li>Avoiding        &quot;undifferentiated heavy-lifting&quot; allows the customer to spend        less time supporting the IT infrastructure, and more time supporting the        business.</li>
