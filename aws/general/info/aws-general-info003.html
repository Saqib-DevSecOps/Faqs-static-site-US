  <li value="1">The name <em>Hyperscale</em> implies extreme growth</li>
  <li>&quot;In computing, hyperscale is the ability of an architecture to scale appropriately as increased demand is added to the system.&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperscale_computing" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</li>
  <li>Hyperscale operators, or Hyperscalers are companies who offer IT, social media and other hosted services, on a broad scale. These include cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, Facebook, Apple, Salesforce, etc.</li>
  <li>As described by IBM, &quot;Hyperscaler: Provides computing architecture to appropriately scale as customers increase system demand. Hyperscaling typically involves seamlessly provisioning and adding compute, memory, networking, and storage resources to a given node or set of nodes that comprise a larger computing, distributed computing, or grid computing environment. Examples of hyperscalers are Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google GCP, Alibaba AliCloud, IBM, and Oracle.&quot;</li>
  <li>In 2017, Synergy Research Group said it identified 24 companies who met its definition of a hyperscaler.</li>
  <li>In 2021, the top three hyperscalers by market share are: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Platform.</li>
