  <li value="1">Which AWS Services are free?
<em hidden="categorymeta">[AWS: General: AWS Services]</em>
<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">We can opt to talk about a number of things here, including the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" target="_blank">Free Tier</a> account, which allows new AWS customers try out AWS services free of charge, up to a  limit for each service.</li>
  <li>Outside of the AWS Free Tier, there are several free services categories:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">Threshold-base free services are services where the service, or some aspect of the service is made free, up to a certain threshold, beyond that, charges apply. For example, AWS Lambda provides 1 million requests free per month, indefinitely</li>
    <li>Free services that only charge for underlying services. For example, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a service for developers to quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. There is no charge for using AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You pay for AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instances or S3 buckets) you create to store and run your application</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Find a lot of the <strong><em>free</em></strong> services by visiting the URL with this format: <em>aws.amazon.com/free/&lt;category-name&gt;</em>, where <em>&lt;category-names&gt;</em> include: analytics, compute, database, machine-learning, networking, storage, etc. e.g. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/storage/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/free/storage/</a>.<br>
