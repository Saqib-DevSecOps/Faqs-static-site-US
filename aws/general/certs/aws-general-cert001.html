  <li value="1">Any advice about taking the online proctored AWS Certification exam?
<em hidden="categorymeta">[AWS: General: Certifications]</em>
<ol type="a">
  <li value="1">Use your personal computer, not a work computer</li>
  <li>Computer with a webcam</li>
  <li>Be prepared to show a 360o view of the space you are in</li>
  <li>Your testing space should be private and unadorned; with no items that potentially could give you an unfair advantage, e.g. writings on the wall</li>
  <li>An online proctored exam must be completed in a continuous session as breaks will not be allowed</li>
  <li>Use the restroom ahead of time</li>
  <li>Login in 30 minutes advance</li>
  <li>Your test can be cancelled by the proctor if the conditions are not met, e.g. if anyone enters the room while you are taking the exam!</li>
  <li>With PSI, candidates must be able to communicate with the proctor in English, with Pearson VUE, candidates can opt for a Japanese-speaking proctor instead</li>
  <li>You may not be permitted to read the questions out loud</li>
  <li>Local writing material (scratch paper) is not allowed</li>
  <li>&quot;There is no difference in the exams themselves when delivered in an online proctored modality.&quot;</li>
  <li>Both testing providers Pearson VUE and PSI offer both the online proctored and the on-site options. However confirm that the modality you want is available in your area, in the timeframe you want.</li>
  <li>Go to the AWS Certification page, and <a href="https://www.aws.training/certification/?ch=cta&cta=header&p=1" target="_blank">Schedule an exam</a></li>
  <li>Here's a message from <strong><em>Pearson OnVUE</em></strong> on the online proctored exam:</li>

    <tr>
      <td>&quot;If you are taking an online proctored exam in an available country, we strongly recommend using a personal computer (not issued from your employer) and a wired, ethernet connection. The two most frequent causes of technical issues are testing on (1) a work computer and (2) an unreliable internet connection. Security settings from work computers may restrict the software. Unreliable internet connections (wireless network, VPN, mobile hotspot) may lead to being disconnected.&quot;</td>

  <li value="16">Some tips I've picked up about online proctored exam:</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li value="1">Online is better from a convenience POV, however, make sure the area is<em>clean</em></li>
    <li>Testing facility is better from a simplicity POV, just show up with ID, and take test</li>
    <li>Make sure you can be undisturbed for the duration of the exam</li>
    <li>No one is allowed to walk into the room while you are testing - most of the time, they will end your test</li>
    <li>Test the software well in advance of the exam</li>
    <li>You'll download an app. Go to their page and test it out in advance</li>
    <li>No extra monitors and peripherals allowed</li>
    <li>Mac or PC, either is fine. It's mainly that you need to be able to show them the area is REALLY clean</li>
    <li>No speaking, swearing, or muttering acceptable, even if you are alone</li>
    <li>you can't even move your lips</li>
    <li>If you are someone who needs to mouth the words / read aloud to yourself, go into a testing center.</li>
    <li>Have your phone handy, however make sure its visible to the proctor. You may be asked to keep it  out of easy reach</li>
    <li>It has facial recognition and will go red silhouette if you move out of frame</li>
    <li>Have your laptop/computer connected to a power supply</li>
    <li>This is a lot. at a facility just be prepared and show up and pass. Super easy in and out</li>
