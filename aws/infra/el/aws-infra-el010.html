    <li>You may consider        Regional Edge Caches as providing a backup function for Edge Locations</li>
    <li>When content is cached at        the Edge Location, a copy is also placed in the Regional Edge Cache</li>
    <li>There are fewer Regional        Edge Caches than there are Edge Locations, however each Regional Edge        Cache is much larger than each Edge Location. As such it can hold content        for longer.</li>
    <li>IfÂ  content ages out of the Edge Location,        chances are good that it will still be available in the Regional Edge        Cache, as such it can be served</li>
