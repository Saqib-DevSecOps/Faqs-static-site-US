    <li>Specific types of AWS Regions are grouped into AWS Partitions. For standard AWS Regions, the partition is aws. For resources in other partitions, the partition naming convention is aws-partitionname. E.g. aws-cn for China (Beijing and Ningxia) Regions, and aws-us-gov for resources in the AWS GovCloud Regions</li>
