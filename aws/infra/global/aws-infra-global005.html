    <li value="1">According to        Netflix they began their cloud migration in August 2008.</li>
    <li>Netflix chose Amazon Web        Services as their cloud provider for AWS' scale and broad set of services        and features.</li>
    <li>By 2016, Netflix had        migrated all streaming services fully to the cloud, shutting down their        last remaining related data center.</li>
    <li>In a 2016 blog post, Netflix        touted its Netflix Open Connect service, its globally distributed CDN.        They use it to deliver 100% of their video traffic.</li>
    <li>&quot;Essentially everything        before you hit play happens in AWS, including all of the logic of        the application interface, the content discovery and selection        experience, recommendation algorithms, transcoding, &quot; online        storage, recommendation engine, video transcoding, databases, analytics,        etc.</li>
    <li>However Netflix operates its        own system of partner ISPs (Internet Service Providers), networks,        technical expertise and appliances called Netflix Open Connect to create        a CDN service for the actual content streaming.</li>
    <li>A user on Quora.com put it        very nicely, &quot;Netflix uses AWS for their control plane. Anything        that doesn&rsquo;t involve serving video is handled in AWS. All video is        streamed over Netflix&rsquo;s purpose built Open Connect CDN (Content Delivery        Network). That&rsquo;s their data plane.&quot;</li>
