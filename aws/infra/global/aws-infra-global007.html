    <li value="1">&quot;AWS will        deliver Outposts servers directly to you, and you can either have your        onsite personnel install them or an AWS preferred third-party contractor.</li>
    <li>After the Outposts servers        are connected to your network, AWS will remotely provision compute and        storage resources so you can start launching applications.&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;If there is a need to        replace physical equipment, AWS will notify you and ship an appropriate        module to your site. There is no additional charge for this, as hardware        is included as part of the Outposts service price.&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;If there is a need to        perform physical maintenance (on Outposts Rack), AWS will reach out to        schedule a time to visit your site. AWS may replace a given module as        appropriate but will not perform any host or network switch servicing on        customer premises.&quot;</li>
