  <li value="1">Possible, however not       probable</li>
  <li>Availability Zones (AZs)are a       high availability feature in AWS</li>
  <li>Every current AWS Region has       at least 3 AZs. Depending on the business criticality, customer can choose       to deploy across two or more AZs</li>
  <li>Also AZs are located up to       100 KM or 60 miles from each other. Chances of, for example a natural       disaster affecting two AZs at the same time are low</li>
  <li>Organizations should design       their high-availability architectures to meet their business and mission       needs, including planning for cross-region HA if appropriate</li>
