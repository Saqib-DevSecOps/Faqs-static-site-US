  <li value="1">Points of Presence (POP) in       AWS is a part of the AWS Global Infrastructure, and consists of a network       of global Edge Locations</li>
  <li>An Edge Location is an AWS       facility whose task is to cache content closer to the end-user, so       end-users can consume that content more efficiently, i.e. lower latency,       better performance.</li>
  <li>The end-user       consumes the content, served from the POP, as such end-users select the       services that uses POP or edge locations</li>
  <li>A content provider would leverage the Amazon CloudFront service to make       their content available in the POP, as such content providers select POP       as a service</li>
